            PDF Viewing and Printing Tips
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Many Mothership pdf files are intended to be viewed as a two page spread, and printed as booklets. Most browsers and Acrobat Reader
            default to a single page view, and Print settings also usually default to a single page.

              Acrobat Reader
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Acrobat Reader allows you select a Two-page view, and has an option "Show cover page", which displays the cover page seperately.
            This is usually what you want.

              Chrome
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            At the time of writing, Chrome does give you the option to set the two page view with a seperate cover.
            You can get around this by using "Print as PDF" to create a coverless copy for viewing.

            To set Chrome for two page viewing, open the pdf file, then use the hamburger menu on the to right, and
            select "Two page view".

              Printing Booklets
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
              If the pdf is a collection of 5.5" x 8.5" pages, select "Booklet" when printing, then check the preview.
              Ensure you are priting on both sides of the paper.
              This should print two pages of the pdf on each 8.5" x 11" sheet, that you can then fold in half to make a booklet.
