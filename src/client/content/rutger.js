                Rutger is an uplifted chimpanzee that communcites with his peers via a text-to-speech device. 
                He wears a patch that reads "Not a Monkey", and has a hot-key at the ready with that phrase.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rutger survived <i>Vita Nova</i> and <i>Black Pyramid</i>. He is now a Teamster on the USCSS Kestrel.

                'Rutger' was created as an NPC by Charles Allen, but became a replacement PC played by Jonathan Schell.
